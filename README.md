## About

This repository contains a series of projects and tasks aimed at teaching and practicing:

- The basics of the C programming language
- Compilation, debugging, and testing in C
- Working with data structures, algorithms, and memory management
- Understanding and using Linux/Unix system calls
- Building and managing static libraries

Each subdirectory corresponds to a specific project or concept as outlined in the ALX curriculum.

- Each folder contains source code files, header files, and README documentation for specific tasks.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Adameelmadani/alx-low_level_programming.git
   cd alx-low_level_programming
   ```

2. **Browse to a project directory:**
   ```sh
   cd 0x00-hello_world
   ```

3. **Compile a sample C file:**
   ```sh
   gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic sample.c -o sample
   ```

## How to Use

- Each directory contains several `.c` source files and, in some cases, test files.
- Read the `README.md` in each subdirectory for specific project instructions.
- Execute compiled binaries using:
  ```sh
  ./program_name
  ```

## Requirements

- GCC compiler (typically `gcc`, version 4.8+)
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or compatible Unix/Linux system
- Betty style checker (for code style compliance)
